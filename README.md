## Introduction
  League of Legends is a brisk, competitive, online game combining the excitement of strategy games with elements of role-playing games. Two teams of champions, unique in design and gameplay, compete head-to-head in various battlefields and game modes. League of Legends is a game that players of all skill levels can play for a very long time without getting bored, with its constantly varying champions, frequently updated content and live tournament environment. League of Legends is a struggle of 2 teams of 5 each to demolish each other's center on a map of 3 corridors.
   This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level. There are 19 features per team (38 in total) collected after 10min in-game. This includes kills, deaths, gold, experience, levelâ€¦ It's up to you to do some feature engineering to get more insights. The column blueWins is the target value (the value we are trying to predict). A value of 1 means the blue team has won.
